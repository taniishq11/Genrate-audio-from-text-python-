# Text-to-Speech Converter
This project provides a simple implementation of text-to-speech functionality with an easy-to-use graphical interface.

# Features:
Users can enter text in an input field.
On clicking the "Start" button, the text is converted into speech using the gTTS library.
The generated speech is saved as an output.mp3 file and played automatically.
